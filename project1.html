                            <p>In 1763, Richard Price, a moral philosopher, introduced the essay, “An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Indoctrine of Chances,” by Thomas Bayes. <img src="images/ThomasBayes.png"  class="Thomas" alt="Thomas Bayes Image"> /
                            Naïve Bayes theorem is now a fundamental tool in statistical and Machine Learning. However, the origins of this tool are very unexpected. 
                            This theorem was invented by an English Presbyterian minister in an attempt to prove God’s existence. Thomas Bayes passed away in the year 1763, however, his essay was posthumously published in 1766 by Price. However, during the time of its publication, the essay was not given it’s right recognition, as the mathematics was too extensive to prove. It wasn’t until the invention of the modern computer, with fast processors, that we found the full potential of this mathematical tool. </p>

                        <section>
                            <h3>So what Is Naïve Bayes Theorem?</h3>
                            <p>This theorem allows us to mathematically incorporate data correctly, and calculate the probabilities of an event. It’s a tool that is versatile because it penetrates almost all questions that come to mind, from healthcare-related probabilities to coding to presidential elections. The Bayes’ rule helps us determine the probability that something is true with a given set of events.</p>
                            <div class="formula">
                                <strong>Bayes' Rule:</strong><br>
                                \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \)
                            </div>
                            <p>Here, A is the hypothesis and B is data. \( P(A|B) \) means the probability of A given B. \( P(B|A) \) means the probability of B given A.</p>
                            <div class="formula">
                                <strong>Bayes' Rule Example:</strong><br>
                                \( P(\text{Cancer}|\text{Positive Test}) = \frac{P(\text{Positive Test}|\text{Cancer}) \cdot P(\text{Cancer})}{P(\text{Positive Test})} \)
                            </div>
                            <p>So here the initial probabilities would be based on clinical outcomes.</p>
                            <h3> Let’s do a few sample problems to get a gist </h3> 
                            <h4> Problem 1: Breast Cancer Outcomes </h4>
                            <p> Suppose a mammography screening test for breast cancer has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 93%. The prevalence of breast cancer in the population is 1%. A woman undergoes a mammography screening and the test results come back positive. What is the probability that she actually has breast cancer? </p>
                            <h2>Solution:</h2>
                            <p>Let's define the following:</p>
                            <div class="formula">
                            <ul>
                                <li>P(A) = Probability of having breast cancer = 0.01 (prevalence)</li>
                                <li>P(B|A) = Probability of testing positive given breast cancer = 0.90 (sensitivity)</li>
                                <li>P(¬A) = Probability of not having breast cancer = 1 - P(A) = 0.99</li>
                                <li>P(B|¬A) = Probability of testing positive given no breast cancer = 1 - specificity = 1 - 0.93 = 0.07</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Now, let's apply Bayes' theorem:</p>
                            <p>P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]</p>
                            <p>Substituting the values:</p>
                            <p>P(A|B) = (0.90 * 0.01) / [(0.90 * 0.01) + (0.07 * 0.99)]</p>
                            <p>P(A|B) ≈ 0.1136</p>
                            <p>So, the probability that the woman actually has breast cancer given a positive mammography screening result is approximately 11.36%.</p>
                            <h4> Problem 2: Weather Outlook </h4>
                            <p> Marie is getting married tomorrow at an outdoor ceremony in the desert. In recent years it has rained only 5 days, each year (5/365 = 0.014). Unfortunately, the weatherman has predicted rain for tomorrow. When it rains the weatherman correctly forecasts the rain 90% of the time.  It is 10% of the time when it predicts it incorrectly. What is the probability that it will rain on Marie’s wedding? </p> 
                            <h2>Solution:</h2>
                            <p>Given:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>P(rain) = Probability of rain = 0.014</li>
                                <li>P(Prediction|rain) = Probability of correct prediction given rain = 0.90</li>
                                <li>P(¬rain) = Probability of no rain = 1 - P(rain) = 0.986</li>
                                <li>P(Prediction|¬rain) = Probability of incorrect prediction given no rain = 0.10</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Using the provided equation:</p>
                            <p>P(rain|Prediction) = (P(Prediction|rain) * P(rain)) / P(prediction)</p>
                            <p>Calculate the denominator \( P(prediction) \):</p>
                            <p>P(prediction) = P(Prediction|rain) * P(rain) + P(Prediction|¬rain) * P(¬rain)</p>
                            <p>P(prediction) = 0.90 * 0.014 + 0.10 * 0.986 = 0.0126 + 0.0986 = 0.1112</p>
                            <p>Substitute \( P(prediction) \) back into the equation:</p>
                            <p>P(rain|Prediction) = (0.90 * 0.014) / 0.1112</p>
                            <p>P(rain|Prediction) = 0.0126 / 0.1112 ≈ 0.1132</p>
                        </div>
                            <p>So, the probability that it will rain on Marie's wedding given the weatherman's prediction is approximately 11.32%.</p>
